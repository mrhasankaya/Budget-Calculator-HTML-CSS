* _INTRODUCTION_ :

One of the biggest challenges of enterprises is that surrounding is greater aggressive than it used to be. Those results in extended strain withinside the workplace. Therefore, the future of any enterprise depends on unachievable enterprise dreams, even an extended chance of unemployment can improve people's pressure levels. Often the non-stop presence of such elements turns into destructive to a person's health and consequently productivity of the company. 
Accordingly, in this project absenteeism data was analyzed first with statistical and exploratory data analysis. Also, the preparation for the logistic regression model to get more insight and predict the occurrence of the subject.


* _DATA_: 

There are 28 variables in our data in which some of them are independent variables and 1 (Absenteeism time in hours) is dependent variable. Since the type of target variable is continuous, this is a regression problem. We categorized some reasons which are similar. Manuel classifying the same reasons into group in order to decrease dimensionality of the data.
    

* _MODEL_:

*Logistic regression* : It is a sort of a regression model whose established variable is binary. That is, the latter can expect one of  two values – zero or one,  True or False, Yes or No. Therefore, thinking about the values of all our features, we need with a view to expect whether or not the established variable will take the value of zero or one. Apart from logistic regression, there are numerous different forms of equations that will let you calculate the established variable in a distinct way. Logistic regression is simply one in every of them – and it's far one which has been used massively.
